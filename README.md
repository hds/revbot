# Revbot

This is a bot that informs about code reviews.

It implements a webhook that supports GitLab and sends messages to users with
the same email address in Webex.

This project is based on [Gerritbot](https://github.com/boxdot/gerritbot-rs) by
[boxdot](https://github.com/boxdot). The parts that aren't strongly influenced
by Gerritbot are just plain copied. Also, Revbot only supports a fraction of
the features that Gerritbot has.

More details on usage to come.
